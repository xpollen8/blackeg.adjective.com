	[1994]
	<blockquote>
	   Have succeeded in booking Strangelove for the second annual
	"It's Got To Be Belgium" festival here - at a price of... NOTHING!
	Ha!Ha!Ha!  It will be their first gig after the l.p. comes out.
	Also lined up for the fest are Curt's mob,
	"Stranger Tractors", Spittle Rattle, Transambient Communications and,
	coup of coups!, a band from Vienna called The Black Eg.
	<p>
	This is all across <a href="https://jazzbutcher.com/gigs/1994/Aug6.html">8th-10th
	August in the garden at Belgium.</a>
	[<b>Slurp's Wino Bar</b>, Northampton, England].
	The Eg are also playing a rave in London on 22nd July at The Fortress,
	King's Cross, and they have been invited to Ibiza too!  Vibornye!
